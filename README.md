# 📌 Python Projects

A collection of **entry-level Python projects** showcasing foundational programming concepts through both **console-based applications** and **simple UI-based games using Pygame**.  
These projects focus on logic building, user input handling, and interactive program flow.

---

## 📂 Repository Overview

This repository is organized into two main categories:
- **Console Projects** – terminal-based programs focused on Python fundamentals
- **Pygame Projects** – simple interactive games with graphical user interfaces

Each project is designed to reinforce core programming concepts while gradually introducing interaction and user feedback.

## 💽 Console-Based Projects
These projects run in the terminal and emphasize logic, conditionals, loops, and user input.

- **Dice Roller** – Simulates rolling dice using random number generation  
- **Encryption Program** – Encrypts user-input text to demonstrate string manipulation and logic  
- **Number Guessing Game** – Implements conditional logic and loops for interactive gameplay  
- **Quiz Game** – Simple question-and-answer program with scoring logic  
- **Rock, Paper, Scissors** – Classic game demonstrating decision logic and user interaction

## 🖳 Pygame Projects
These projects use **Pygame** to introduce graphical interfaces, event handling, and basic game mechanics.

- **Pop Balloons** – Click-to-target game focused on mouse events, scoring, and random object spawning  
- **Turtle Racing** – Simulation game allowing users to select the number of turtles (2–10) and observe randomized movement
